    <h1>Atmosphere Weather App</h1>
    <h4>Web</h4>
    <p>Atmosphere is a weather app created with usability and simplicity in mind. When I check the weather, I want the information I need as quick as possible. Too often are apps crowded with graphs describing the fluctuations of the air pressure and other information that isn't always what people want. So Atmosphere was designed to, very simply, just tell you the weather. The content follows this simple philosophy, as well as the design and functionality. Users must only swipe left or right to see the forecast for upcoming days.</p>
