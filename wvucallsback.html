    <h1>WVU Calls Back</h1>
    <h4>Print</h4>
    <p>Catcalling, also known as street harassment, has been in the spotlight a lot recently. Personally, I’ve experienced it on campus a few times and it’s a hard feeling to describe. Each interaction definitely made me feel belittled and almost ashamed. So I was curious what other women on WVU’s campus had experienced with catcalling. I didn’t have an answer to the problem, but I wanted to get the conversation going and get womens’ stories out there. The idea behind the design was something that mimicks the act of catcalling, something that grabs your attention and puts you off guard, confusing and out of place. So I did a survy among girls and found some of the most common catcalls that they had experienced, the top two being "Dat ass" and "Damn girl". The design was created to appear very feminine and sweet to sort of mock the idea that catcalling is a sincere compliment, like giving flowers to a girl. The final aspect of the design is the placement of the posters on a corner. This was done specifically to engage the viewer, letting them see only one half before the other so they have to walk around to understand its meaning. This also refers again to the experience of being catcalled, the confusion it causes and how it makes the recipient question its purpose. The other side had information about a twitter handle and hashtag encouraging people to share their thoughts. The response was incredible, filling up twitter feeds and even making the news and broadcast across the state, giving womens’ opinions the attention they deserved.
