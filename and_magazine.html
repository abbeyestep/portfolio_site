    <h1>And Magazine</h1>
    <h4>Publications</h4>
    <p>Weddings are becoming more and more expensive, and being a believer in romance, not reception bills, I wanted to create a wedding magazine that's about more than the wedding, it's about getting married. And Magazine focuses mainly on elopements and small scale weddings, for the spontaneous soul mates who just want to get married, no matter what. With tips and featured weddings, And Magazine gives couples a realistic planning guide to make their day theirs, because it's about them, not pleasing the guests.</p>
