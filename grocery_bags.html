    <h1>A Study of Grocery Bags</h1>
    <h4>Photography</h4>
    <p>This typology projects was a study of grocery bags. Plastic bags are everywhere. You could probably look in your kitchen, bathroom, or car and find a good amount of old grocery bags. I worked at Kroger in high school, so I've handled more of these bags than I would like to admit. They are so mass produced that they are almost invisible. So I wanted to, for once, really look at grocery bags. Examine them more closely, specifically the organic shapes they make after being used. I had a container filled with bags, so I took them out one by one, let them unravel naturally and photographed them. Each one seemed to have its own unique shape and personality. Looking at the pictures from afar, it is hard to tell that they are all the same mass-produced object.</p>
