    <h1>Relocated</h1>
    <h4>Photography</h4>
    <p>In the summer of 2013, my family got the news that they were being relocated. My father, a pastor, was being moved four hours away to become a district superintendent. He had, until then, been the pastor of two churches for 13 years. My family was hesitant, but pastors do not always have a choice. It was very difficult and now, two years later, they still feel like strangers in their new home, Romney, WV. So I wanted to document this strange experience of relocation and abandonment through my family and the town of Romney itself.</p>
